TODO

3. Root move ordering based on node counts
5. Do king-safety at root and maybe tell partner whether trades are good
6b. Reimplement hashtables (save move to avoid movegen ?)
7. Check Internal iterative deepening (prolly not working)
12a. BPGN support
13. Prevent blocking of rooks at a8 in standard mode (cfr. crafty)
15. Just keep researching if dead
16. Remove has_castled dependencies
17. If partner tells +++ override alpha-beta with a special check
20. Slit up movegen to do captures and normal moves seperately
21. Scale kingsafety by pieces in hand
22. Implement a configuration file
23. Add endgame database support
24. Experiment with TD learning

MAYBE

8. Threat heuristics
9. Check whether material is still correctly being updated
10. Razor dropchecks if checking piece is enprise
11. Add a feature to anticipate trades
12. Force moving into mate
13. Reset PV on fail-high also in normal search ?

DONE

0. Rank/File arrays
1. Implement +piece commands
2. Fix bugs in standard chess (pawn transformations)
6a. Positional learning
12b. Hashed opening bo
14. Check whether bad trades are evaluated in Reggies code
19. Make a decent makefile / use autoconfig etc...

DIDN'T WORK

18. No legal move check if move is from hashtable

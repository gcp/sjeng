What is Sjeng ?
---------------

Sjeng is a chessprogram that plays the crazyhouse and bughouse
variants. In addition to that, it can also play normal chess
and is fully compatible with the standard XBoard/WinBoard 
protocol.

Technically, Sjeng is a highly advanced alpha-beta searcher, 
using modern techniques like history and killer moves, 
transposition tables, internal interative deepening, MVA/LVV
move ordering, and search enhancements like selective
extensions, Dynamic Principal Variation Search, Adaptive
nullmove pruning, Extended Futility Pruning and Limited 
Razoring. Sjeng can use an opening book and learns from
the games it plays.


How do I get it to work ?
-------------------------

 Building it
 -----------

    GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, other Un*x variants:
    ----------------------------------------
 
    Building Sjeng should be as simple as:

    ./configure
    make
    (su to root)
    make install
 
    If you want to squeeze the last bit of
    performance out of Sjeng, try this:

    ./configure
    cat *.c > blob.c
    gcc -O9 -mpentiumpro -funroll-loops -s -o sjeng blob.c

    If you do not have an x86 machine, or an older version
    of gcc that doesn't recognize the '-mpentiumpro' flag,
    you can safely remove it.

    Windows
    -------

    I have succesfully compiled older versions of Sjeng with
    Microsoft Visual C++. Newer versions should work too,
    although they are not as well tested. 

    You will have to create a config.h file which contains
    
    #define HAVE_SYS_TIMEB_H
    #define HAVE_FTIME
    #define VERSION "7.0"

    You may have to define _WIN32 also.

    Alternatively you can use the Cygnus utilities. I have
    never used them myself so I cannot help you there, but
    you will probably have little or no trouble compiling
    Sjeng with them.
 
 The opening books
 -----------------

 Copy the files zh.opn and normal.opn from the books directory
 to the directory from where you will be running Sjeng. Next,
 copy the zh.opn file to bug.opn. It is not yet recommended to
 use the bug.opn file from the books directory.

 It is important that you keep starting Sjeng from the same 
 directory, because otherwise it will not be able to find its 
 opening books and it will not learn from the games it plays.

 Getting an interface
 --------------------

 You can start Sjeng now by typing 'sjeng', but you will probably
 find the text-based interface unpleasant.

 The recommended interface for playing with Sjeng is 
 WinBoard/XBoard, by Tim Mann.

 http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/mann/xboard.html

 Unfortunately WinBoard/XBoard does not provide any option to
 play bughouse or crazyhouse, only standard chess. The Zippy
 interface (the part that connects to the chess servers) built 
 into WinBoard/XBoard *does* support bughouse and crazyhouse though.

 Vassili Sukharev told me he was extending his bughouse-database
 program to work with Sjeng. His homepage is at:

 http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vassili/ 

 (at the moment of this writing no support was available yet)
 
Tuning Sjeng
------------

In the file ttable.c, you can change TTSIZE from 500000
to a higher number. This will improve performance, as 
long as your system does not have to swap to disk because
of it.

If you use Sjeng to play bughouse, you can do the same
with ECACHESIZE in ecache.c. This is not so imporant
as TTSIZE is.


Getting more info
-----------------

For more info about Sjeng, you can visit the homepage

http://sjeng.sourceforge.net/

and the project homepage:

http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4560

The project homepage allows you to browse the public
forums, access the mailinglists, submit bugs etc... 

Visiting it is recommended, especially if you are
interested in the development of Sjeng. If you are
interested in improving Sjeng, send me a mail at

gcp@users.sourceforge.net

For general questions about the usage of Sjeng, subscribe
to the users mailinglist via the following link:

Reporting bugs
--------------

You can either use the bug-tracker on the project
homepage (recommended), or send email to

sjeng-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

Please try to provide an accurate description of the 
problem and, if possible, how to reproduce it.


New versions
------------

New versions of Sjeng which contain bugfixes and new
features are released from time to time. If you want
to be notified of new releases, subscribe to the 
sjeng-announce mailinglist via the following page:

http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/sjeng-announce


What is bughouse ?
------------------

Bughouse is a form of chess which is played with 2 teams, 
each consisting of 2 players. Each player plays his opponent
on a seperate board. If a piece is captured, the capturing 
player can pass it on to his partner, who can then drop the 
piece into his game and use it.

If you have never played bughouse before, you are really
missing out on something. Try it, you'll like it.

What is crazyhouse ?
--------------------

Crazyhouse is similar to bughouse, but is played
with only 2 players, on 1 board.


Where can I play this game ?
----------------------------

The most common place to play bughouse is the Free Internet
Chess Server (FICS). Most important chess servers also offer
it, like the Internet Chess Club.

http://www.chessclub.com

Or even better, gather a few friends, 2 chessboards, 2 clocks,
some beer, and have fun beating each other ;)
